    <h2>What is Virtualization?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>In simple terms, virtualization allows someone to do something on a machine, while the main purpose of the machine is something different.
    More specifically, virtualization gives the ability for software developers to run multiple instances of their code on a single machine and see
    how each one reacts independently. Each of the machines are isolated from one another, so the effects of one will not alter the others.<br><br>
    According to redhat.com, the idea of virtualization came in the 1960's, but it wasn't widely used until the early 2000's. There are multiple uses
    for virtualization. One of the uses could be for testing software, another use could be partitioning a machine to run as a server and having
    the partition be dedicated to the one task. The most well known virtualization task is creating a virtual desktop. This allows someone
    to run a desktop on their machine that is separate from their main desktop. Like the other examples, the machine will be partitioned and it will
    have resources allocated specifically to that task and be separate from the main machine.
    <br><br>
    This example from redhat.com shows how virtualization can be used to minimize the amount of infrastructure required for multiple tasks</p><br>
    <img src="img/server-usage.png">
    <p>In this image, there are three machines which each run at a third of their capacity and have their own task. Running each task this way
    requires all three machines to be present. Instead of running each task this way, a virtual environment could be used to condense tasks down into two
    machines</p><br>

    <img src="img/server-virtual.png">

    <p>In the second image, a virtual environment is established on the first machine and it allows for two tasks to be run on a single machine. The machines
    are partitioned, so each of the tasks are getting 30% of the machine's resources, just as they did while they each ran on their own machines. Using two
    machines instead of three could reduce upkeep demands and decreases the amount of physical hardware required to maintain each task. Using virtualization in
    this way is extremely effective.</p><br>

    <h3>How virtualization works</h3> <br>
    <p>Virtualization works by using software called hypervisors. The role of hypervisors is to separate physical memory from the resources allocated to the
    virtual environment, and then utilize those allocated resources for the virtual environment.</p><br>
    <img src="img/hypervisor.png"> <br><br>
    <p>In this image, it can be seen how the hypervisor separates each of the tasks that the virtual machines will be used for. The three physical
    machines will be used for 4 virtual machines, and they will be partitioned and ran separate from one another and do not rely on one another.</p>
