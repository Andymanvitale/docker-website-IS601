    <h2>What is Containerization?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>Containerization is the alternative way of creating a virtual machine, but doesn't supply you with the extra features that comes with a virtual machine.
        This allows someone who wants to run multiple programs across the same operating systems the ability to do so, and they could test their software without
        the need to set up an entire virtual machine.<br><br>
        Having a container allows someone to create a portable and low-resource tool which will run their desired programs. These programs are all created on an
        operating system and run through a Runtime engine. The runtime engine is the tool that allows the programs to run. Each of the containers are created
        with something like Docker, and the images gathered are what allow the dockerfile to run successfully. As each of the containers run, they all take up a small
        amount of resources, and they can be developed one at a time without having an effect on one another. <br><br></p>

    <p>In this picture, it can be seen how the host OS is where everything is run. Following that, the container engine is
    something like Docker. Each app is run through the run-time system and it creates 3 different environments specifically running only the application.</p>
    These are small and modular, and allow for easy access and changes to be made without having to restart an entire virtual environment.
