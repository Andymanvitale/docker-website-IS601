    <h2>What's the Difference?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>When comparing the two, each clearly has a benefit over the other for specific purposes. For example, if you wanted multiple copies of the same product
    but didn't want to go through the hassle of having multiple virtual environments, then using a container would allow for changes to be made and the resources
    required for it would be not nearly as great as a virtual environment would require.<br><br>
    The benefits of a virtual environment is that having allocated resources for each partition would allow for each of them to run on their own operating system
    in the virtual environment. If this is something that could be a benefit, for example testing something which is resource heavy and dependent on many functions
    of the OS, then using a virtual environment would be best. Looking at security, the winner goes to virtualization. Having each application run on an
    independent OS allows for the traffic of it to go through that OS instead of the host OS. <br><br>
    On the other hand, using a container is better if there is a smaller project that doesn't require as many resources or apps to run. When setting up a container,
    you have the option to choose which processes to run and it allows for a more streamlined service. Having that modularity allows for faster start times and
    less resource requirements. Unfortunately, using a container to run software would mean that everything still flows through the main operating system and is
        at the mercy of the security features of the OS.</p><br><br><hr>

    <p>Comparing these two images, they have similarities and differences. On the left, the virtualization begins at the host OS and moves into the hypervisor. This
    is what partitions and allocates resources to be used for each independent OS as they run. They are each resource heavy and demand more than a container. <br><br>
    On the right, the containerization example begins at the Host OS just as the other does. It moves into a container engine, such as Docker, and that is what
    you can use to build images to run the needed applications. Each of these run independently just like the virtual environments, but they are not run on their
    own operating systems, they are instead run through a Linux window and run on the host OS, whatever it might be.</p>
